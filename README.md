# Recorder.js

## A plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes

### Syntax
#### Constructor
    var rec = new Recorder([config])

Creates a recorder instance.

- **config** - An optional configuration object (see **config** section below)

---------
#### Config

- **enableMonitoring** - (*optional*) If you want the hear the recorder input live. Defaults to false
- **workerPath** - (*optional*) Path to recorder.js worker script. Defaults to 'recorderWorker.js'
- **bufferLength** - (*optional*) The length of the buffer that the internal JavaScriptNode uses to capture the audio. Can be tweaked if experiencing performance issues. Defaults to 4096.
- **numberOfChannels** - (*optional*) The number of channels to record. 1 = mono, 2 = stereo. Defaults to 2
- **sampleRate** - (*optional*) The sample rate to record at. Defaults to audio device native sample rate. If different than the audio device rate, the audio will be resampled using a linear interpolation algorithm.
- **bitDepth** - (*optional*) The bit depth to record at. Defaults to 16. Supported values are 8, 16, 24, 32. No dither is added when reducing bit rate.

---------
#### Instance Methods

    rec.startRecording()

**startRecording** will begin capturing audio.

    rec.pauseRecording()

**pauseRecording** will keep the stream and monitoring alive, but will not be recording the buffers. Subsequent calls to **startRecording** will add to the current recording.

    rec.stopRecording()

**stopRecording** will cease capturing audio and disable the monitoring and mic input stream. Subsequent calls to **startRecording** will require authorization to access the input stream again before adding to the current recording.

    rec.clear()

This will clear the data buffers of any recorded data.

    rec.enableMonitoring()
    rec.disableMonitoring()

This will enable and disable the live monitoring of your mic input. Headphones are recommended if enabling monitoring to avoid feedback noise.

    rec.getWav( callback[, mimeType])

This will generate a Blob object containing the recording in WAV format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument.

In addition, you may specify the mime type of Blob to be returned (defaults to "audio/wav").

    rec.get( callback )

This will pass the recorded audio as an array of Uint8Arrays for each channel to the callback.

    rec.getInterleaved( callback )

This will pass the recorded audio as one Uint8Array with channels interleaved to the callback.

---------
#### Static Methods

    Recorder.isRecordingSupported()

Will return a boolean value indicating if the browser supports recording.
