# Recorder.js

## A plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes

### Syntax
#### Constructor
    var rec = new Recorder(config)

Creates a recorder instance.

- **config** - A configuration object (see **config** section below)

---------
#### Config

- **sourceNode** - (*required*) the audio node with which to record from. Required field
- **workerPath** - (*optional*) Path to recorder.js worker script. Defaults to 'recorderWorker.js'
- **bufferLen** - (*optional*) The length of the buffer that the internal JavaScriptNode uses to capture the audio. Can be tweaked if experiencing performance issues. Defaults to 4096.
- **mimeType** - (*optional*) The mime type of the Blob generated by `getWavBlob`. Defaults to 'audio/wav'.
- **numberOfChannels** - (*optional*) The number of channels to record. 1 = mono, 2 = stereo. Defaults to 2

---------
#### Instance Methods

    rec.startRecording()
    rec.stopRecording()

Pretty self-explanatory... **startRecording** will begin capturing audio and **stopRecording** will cease capturing audio. Subsequent calls to **startRecording** will add to the current recording.

    rec.clear()

This will clear the recording.

    rec.getWavBlob( callback[, mimeType])

This will generate a Blob object containing the recording in WAV format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument.

In addition, you may specify the mime type of Blob to be returned (defaults to value specified in config).

    rec.getBuffer( callback )

This will pass the recorded stereo buffer (as an array of Float32Arrays for the separate channels) to the callback. It can be played back by creating a new source buffer and setting these buffers as the separate channel data:

	function getBufferCallback( buffers ) {
		var newSource = audioContext.createBufferSource();
		var newBuffer = audioContext.createBuffer( 2, buffers[0].length, audioContext.sampleRate );
		newBuffer.getChannelData(0).set(buffers[0]);
		newBuffer.getChannelData(1).set(buffers[1]);
		newSource.buffer = newBuffer;

		newSource.connect( audioContext.destination );
		newSource.start(0);
	}

This sample code will play back the stereo buffer.

    rec.isRecording

is a boolean indicating if the instance is actively recording or not.
