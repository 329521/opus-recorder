# Recorder.js

A library for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes.

This is a experimental version which supports encoding the audio using libopus ver 1.1 compiled with emscripten.

### Syntax
#### Constructor
    var rec = new Recorder([config]);

Creates a recorder instance. Instantiating an instance will prompt the user for permission to access the audio input stream.

- **config** - An optional configuration object (see **config** section below)

---------
#### Config

- **enableMonitoring** - (*optional*) If you want the hear the recorder input live. Defaults to false
- **bitDepth** - (*optional*) Specifies the bitdepth to record at. Defaults to 16. Supported values are 8, 16, 24, 32. If recordOpus is true, this value will be ignored.
- **bufferLength** - (*optional*) The length of the buffer that the internal JavaScriptNode uses to capture the audio. Can be tweaked if experiencing performance issues. Defaults to 4096.
- **numberOfChannels** - (*optional*) The number of channels to record. 1 = mono, 2 = stereo. Defaults to 1. More than two channels has not been tested.
- **recordOpus** - (*optional*) Specifies if recorder should record using the opus encoder. Defaults to true.
- **sampleRate** - (*optional*) Specifies the sample rate to record at. Defaults to device sample rate. If different than native rate, the audio will be resampled using a linear interpolation algorithm.  If recordOpus is true, this value will be ignored.
- **workerPath** - (*optional*) Path to recorder.js worker script. Defaults to 'recorderWorker.js'

#### Instance Methods

    rec.startRecording()

**startRecording** will begin capturing audio.

    rec.pauseRecording()

**pauseRecording** will keep the stream and monitoring alive, but will not be recording the buffers. Subsequent calls to **startRecording** will add to the current recording.

    rec.stopRecording()

**stopRecording** will cease capturing audio and disable the monitoring and mic input stream. Subsequent calls to **startRecording** will require authorization to access the input stream again before adding to the current recording.

    rec.clear()

This will clear the data buffers of any recorded data.

    rec.enableMonitoring()
    rec.disableMonitoring()

This will enable and disable the live monitoring of your mic input. Headphones are recommended if enabling monitoring to avoid feedback noise.

    rec.getWav( callback[, mimeType] )

This will generate a Blob object containing the recording in WAV format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument.

In addition, you may specify the mime type of Blob to be returned (defaults to "audio/wav").

    rec.getOgg( callback[, mimeType] )

This will generate a Blob object containing the opus encoded recording in an Ogg container. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument. If audio was recorded as Wave, an error will be thrown

In addition, you may specify the mime type of Blob to be returned (defaults to "audio/ogg").

    rec.get( format, callback )

This will return the recorded audio in format (supported values are "wav" or "ogg") as a Uint8Array to the callback. If the format type is not supported an error will be thrown.


---------
#### Static Methods

    Recorder.isRecordingSupported()

Will return a boolean value indicating if the browser supports recording.
